## Project Structure
This project consists of two main components. The first part involves evaluating the missing data in each feature and determining the percentage of missing values. In the second part, we will focus on addressing the missing data. We will employ various concepts and methodologies, such as retaining the missing data as is, filling it with appropriate values, or removing it entirely. Throughout this project, we will be working with the Ames dataset, which has already undergone outlier removal. The Ames dataset is a comprehensive collection of housing information in Ames, Iowa, containing various features such as the size, age, and condition of houses, as well as their sale prices. It is often used as a dataset for predictive modeling and regression analysis tasks in the field of data science.
