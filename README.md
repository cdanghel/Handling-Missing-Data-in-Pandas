Welcome to the Handling Missing Data project! This project aims to assess the existing gaps in data by evaluating what is missing, determining the percentage of missing data for each feature, and exploring strategies to effectively address these gaps.

## Project Structure
This project consists of two main components. The first part involves evaluating the missing data in each feature and determining the percentage of missing values. In the second part, we will focus on addressing the missing data. We will employ various concepts and methodologies, such as retaining the missing data as is, filling it with appropriate values, or removing it entirely. Throughout this project, we will be working with the Ames dataset, which has already undergone outlier removal.
